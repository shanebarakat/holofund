# HoloFund - BlockHack Spring 2024

HoloFund is a decentralized finance (DeFi) charity donation app, focused on **transparency** and **trust**. By leveraging blockchain technology, HoloFund provides real-time donation tracking and fund distribution flexibility through smart contract integration.

---

## Inspiration

Charitable organizations often lack sufficient financial audits, creating opportunities for fraud and inefficiency. Inspired by the need for transparency and accountability, we used Ethereum's blockchain to ensure donors can see how their contributions are used, fostering trust without relying on centralized oversight.

## Challenges We Faced

### 1. **Smart Contract Automation and Deployment**
- Struggled with automating smart contract creation using frameworks like Brownie and Waffle.
- Limited experience with Node.js and Solidity made deployment a challenge.

### 2. **Firebase-Flutter-Python Integration**
- Setting up authentication, database connections, and real-time data management proved complex for the short hackathon timeframe.

### 3. **Flutter Collaboration**
- Our teamâ€™s collective passion for UI/UX caused overlapping work and time delays due to limited collaboration tools.
